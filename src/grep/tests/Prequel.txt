[Verse 1]
Dear diary, dear diary, I've been searching for a higher me
I'm in the sky, in the pilot's seat, tryna stop my mind from spiraling
And that's irony, that's irony
I'm just looking for a resolution, I just want to be a better human
But it's hard when everybody's acting stupid
Pardon me if that came off rude, I just have a bad attitude
With the world and not just with you, it's the side effects of abuse
I admit I'm a little strange, I don't think that I'll ever change
I survived a whole life of pain, you could say I escaped my fate
I'm a cynical, egotistical, unpredictable, hardenеd criminal
And I can be a little hypocritical, but I'll admit it straight to your face
I'm unbrеakable, irreplaceable, undeniably inspirational
I used everything I had available to make me the person I am today

[Verse 2]
Dear diary, dear diary, I just had another wild dream
I was in a world that admired me
And when I woke up I was smiling
And that's irony, that's irony
You talk a lot, but you don't even know me
I'm just hoping that my testimony will inspire y'all to stop acting phony
Pardon me if that came off weird, I don't mean to be mean, I swear
I have been through a lot this year
I just want to make a few things clear
I don't like it when people hate behind my back and not to my face
Nowadays it just feels so fake
So I'll cut the grass to expose the snakes
I'm unstoppable, it's impossible
You don't wanna see the diabolical side of me that never stops, is volatile
So I suggest you stay in your lane
I'm unapologetic, you know where it's headed
I will never ever let up off the pedal
I got the spirit of every warrior in me ever
So back the fuck up, get out my face

[Verse 3]
You're a slave to labor and you praise the fascist
You kiss the hand that takes half in taxes
Faking outrage and being seen, a generation with no self-esteem
It's time to rise up and stand against them
Break the chains and finally see the vision
We're post-traumatic from a broken system
Follow me into the chaos engine, ah
It's time to stand, it's time to fight
Don't be afraid to twist the knife
Your sacrifice to break the curse
Prepare to die, prepare to burn
Abandon hope, it's not enough
'Cause all our gods abandoned us
Your sacrifice to break the curse
Light the match, watch it burn

[Bridge]
Oh, heaven falls, the angels die
Let it burn from the start
When everything falls apart

[Outro]
When everything falls apart
Why have you forsaken me?
When everything falls apart
Heavy is the crown, you see
When everything falls apart
Why have you forsaken me?
When everything falls apart
Heavy is the crown, you see
When everything falls apart
When everything falls apart
